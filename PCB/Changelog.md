## Design errors, fixes and improvements between PCB revisions

### V0.1

-   Known issues:
    1. Current Sensor
        - If there is no current sensor wire attached, the INA139 will output 4.3V, killing the ADC and potentially the Microcontroller
        - Solution: Wire a pullup resistor from the C pad to the V+ pad to ensure that the measured current is 0 rather than infinity when there is nothing attached to the C pad.
    2. Buck Converters
        - A diode is misplaced, killing the buck converters
        - Solution: Place the diode in the correct spot on both bucks
    3. Oscillators
        - There is only a spot for crystals but not for their capacitors, and the wiring is wrong for use with oscillators
        - Solution: Change wiring for oscillator for the RP2040
    4. No pullup on the CS line for the flash
    5. Boot button flipped

### V0.2

-   Goal: A working PCB with some tests to make v0.3 the first final version
    -   It uses the same stencil as v0.1, hence I had to make some compromises with regards to routing and other best practices. I didn't want to spend another 15$ on a stencil, when PCBs are so cheap in comparison.
-   Fixes for all 5 problems with v0.1
-   Same stencil
-   Improvements:
    -   0402 solder bridges instead of 0603
    -   8 layers because that allows for free ENIG finish and POFV at JLCPCB
    -   put baro I2C on aux I2C of gyro? => Solder bridge to test this out

### V0.3

-   Goal: V0.2 (and from a purely flying performance perspective v0.1 too) was generally working very well. Goal is to put in some new features especially blackbox on the SD card due to the slow flash writing. Since the microSD has its own buffer, it should be much faster.
-   Improvements
    -   ELRS with true diversity built in
    -   SD card slot for blackbox
    -   new SPI barometer
    -   synchronous buck converters: smaller (, more efficient)
-   Fixes
    -   removed pullup on current sensor (A relic from the INA139)
-   Known issues
    -   100nF 0402 caps on the bottom layer are too close to each other, causing solder bridges - no issue but not ideal
    -   WiFi antenna poor range (5-10 cm), not sure why
    -   ELRS boot pad is hard to reach
    -   SX1281 crystals 90 degrees rotated --> SX1281 doesn't work at all (jank fix works)
    -   forgot I2C pullups. No issue rn (no sensors using I2C), but with a compass it might be
    -   ~~overheating PCB --> at least at double clock speed, the RP2040 gets too hot to after a while (USB stops working). Part of a solution may be to use the 1.8V buck converter inside the SX1281~~ Just fucked up soldering
    -   Bad ELRS range --> a few possible reasons
        -   wrong RF filter (Johanson was out of stock, so I used a Murata one) --> unlikely, see reason for LNA not working + I stole an RF filter from another functioning ELRS RX and it didn't help
        -   LNA not working --> most likely (yet reason still unknown), because the RSSI has a very fast jump from about -25 to -75dBm, indicating something else than a pure passives issue. Also, in the transmission path (telemetry), everything works fine, indicating that the PCB and passive components are fine in general
        -   pads grounded insufficiently --> my bad, I didn't compare the library footprint with the datasheet, some pads are not grounded, as they were marked NC in the library but GND in the datasheet --> I put a solder bridge on the pads that are not grounded, and still it doesn't work well, so still unlikely
        -   AT2401C just not working? --> unlikely, but maybe there's a difference between this clone and the RFX2401C
        -   All of them are pretty unlikely, given the weird jump, but I don't know what else it could be
-   Untested
    -   OSD (does it still work after being moved to SPI1 from SPI0?)
