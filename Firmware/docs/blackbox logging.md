# Blackbox

This Document describes the blackbox logging as of 11th July 2025 (version 0.0.1).

The blackbox is being logged on the SD card on the FC. Blackbox files end in .kbb, e.g. KOLI0001.kbb.
The format is binary, and the first 8 bytes are the magic sequence 0xDC 0xDF 0x4B 0x4F 0x4C 0x49 0x01 0x00, the next 3 bytes indicate the used blackbox format version (binary, e.g. 0x00 0x00 0x01 for 0.0.1).
Magic bytes have the advantage of being able to indicate (not verify) the file type. Many formats use it, e.g. images, I used this post as an inspiration for the type of magic number: https://chaos.social/@zwol@hackers.town/114155807784368727.

The file starts with a header, and then the data frames follow. Numbers of multiple bytes length are stored in Little Endian form. The header is currently 256 bytes long (including the magic number and version), with many bytes being reserved for future use. Since it is planned to store a large part of the settings in the header, this header may grow in the future.

## Header

-   11+4: UNIX timestamp of the start of the log, UTC
-   15+4: uint32 of the duration of the log in milliseconds. Initially set to 0, filled in at the end of the log. Can be used to indicate a broken log, if this is not set to a value greater than 0.
-   19+1: PID rate index, 0 = 3200Hz
-   20+1: blackbox frequency divider, e.g. 1 = 1:1 or 4 = 1:4. 0 is undefined

-   22+36: rate coefficient (fix32[3][3], 16.16 bits, first dimension is the axis: 0 = roll, 1 = pitch, 2 = yaw, second dimension is the type of coefficient: 0 = center, 1 = max, 2 = expo)
-   58+24: unused

-   151+1: Disarm reason
-   rest filled with 0x00

### Blackbox Fields

Currently a 64 bit bitmask, where each bit indicates whether a field is enabled or not. The following fields are currently defined. An asterisk (\*) indicates that this field is not logged in the regular frame, but has its own frame type due to a different update frequency or other reasons. Typically, all fields are two bytes in size, any exceptions are marked with the byte size in brackets.

-   2: `LOG_PITCH_SETPOINT`: 12.4 fixed int of the pitch setpoint in degrees per second

-   42: `LOG_DEBUG_3`: A 16 bit debug variable
-   43: `LOG_DEBUG_4`: A 16 bit debug variable

## Data

Each data frame starts with a frame identifier (1 byte) followed by the frame data. The following data frames exist:

-   0: `BB_FRAME_NORMAL`. The length of this frame is dictated by the enabled blackbox fields. A regular frame includes all the enabled fields, except those previously marked with an asterisk.
-   1: `BB_FRAME_FLIGHTMODE`. This frame is 1 byte long and contains the new flight mode index. This frame is stored as the first data frame after the header to indicate the flight mode at the start of the log.
-   2: `BB_FRAME_HIGHLIGHT`. This frame has no data and just indicates that the user pressed the highlight button on the transmitter. It is logged to mark a point of interest in the log.
-   3: `BB_FRAME_GPS`.This frame is logged when a GPS packet arrives. It is 92 bytes long and contains the raw UBX-NAV-PVT message, which includes the time, position, velocity, and other information. This frame (if enabled) is logged roughly 20 times per second, if the GPS receiver allows that. This frame is only stored if the GPS logging is enabled in the blackbox fields (`LOG_GPS`).
-   4: `BB_FRAME_RC`. This frame is always logged when an RC packet arrives. Since ELRS is asynchronous from the PID loop, this frame is also logged asynchronously and not part of the normal frames. The frame is 6 bytes long and stores the first 4 channels of the RC packet, each from 988-2012 as a uint12. This frame is only logged if the `LOG_ELRS_RAW` field is enabled.

These data frames are chained one after another in the file. To write a flight mode frame (with a switch to flight mode 4), then a highlight frame and then a normal frame, the file would look like this:

```
0x01 0x04 0x02 0x00 [...data for the normal frame...]
^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |       |       |
   |       |       +-- normal frame (0x00 identifier + frame data)
   |       +-- highlight frame (just 0x02 identifier)
   +-- flight mode frame (0x01 identifier + flight mode index, 0x04)
```

Since the frames are generated asynchronously (dual core processor), it is uncertain (by one frame) when exactly the new flight mode applies, when exactly the highlight was pressed or when exactly the new ELRS or GPS data was first processed in the PID controller. Blackbox viewers should align the special frames to the _next_ normal frame, so that e.g. a flight mode change between frames 10 and 11 applies in frame 11.
